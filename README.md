# gif stands for great image format

### disclaimer

this guide is going to talk about gifs in a rather serious manner however when it comes to the more technical parts i will not use the most exact terminology ever so i **STRONGLY** advise you do not skip the next page where i will explain the acronyms and terms i will use, some of them are "correct" but when it comes to acronyms i have a tendency to make up a lot of my own to save me having to copy paste long terms over and over

if you arent interested at all in the explanations about the format etc \(rip my hard work\) then just **click here** to go directly to the process of making a gif from a video but dont complain about not understanding because i warned you beforehand about my crappy terminology  
  
anyhow without further ado lets get down to business and start explaining stuff so please click the button at the bottom of this page to continue
