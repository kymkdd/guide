# gif stands for great image format

### disclaimer

this guide is going to talk about gifs in a rather serious manner however when it comes to the more technical parts i will not use the most exact terminology ever so i **STRONGLY** advise you do not skip the next page where i will explain the acronyms and terms i will use  
some of them are correct but when it comes to acronyms i have a tendency to make up a lot of my own to save me having to copy paste long terms over and over  
  
anyhow without further ado lets get down to business and start explaining stuff so please click the button at the bottom of this page to continue
