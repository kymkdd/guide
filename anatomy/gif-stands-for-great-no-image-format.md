# whats a gif?

first things first we have to establish whats a gif exactly before explaining anything else  
  
so what exactly is a gif? well im glad you asked heres whats inside everyones favorite meme image format

### colors

one of the things that most people think of when they think of gif images \(aside from the fact that they are animated\) its the really awful colors that generally are visible in the form of that pretty iconic "checkered" dithering  
this guide isnt going to cover any dithering methods but _ubitux_ wrote a pretty comprehensive review of different dithering methods and color mapping on [his personal blog ](http://blog.pkh.me/p/21-high-quality-gif-with-ffmpeg.html)which i recommend checking out for additional insight
